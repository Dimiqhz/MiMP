                    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License,
supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other
than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but not including the System Libraries of the Combined
Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument to a function
exclusively defined in the Library), then you may convey a copy of the
modified version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
   this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU LGPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU LGPL and this License.

   d) Do one of the following:
       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
       and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and
       under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the
       Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to
       produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by
       the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU
   GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to
   install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced
   by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified
   version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the
   Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding
   Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1,
   you must provide no Installation Information.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
either under the terms of this License, or under the terms of the GNU
GPL, in a fashion consistent with the normal practice of linking
applications with libraries.  You may convey a Library that is a
work based on the Library under the terms of the GNU GPL, provided that
the license for the work includes a written offer, valid for at least
three years, to give anyone who possesses the object code a copy of the
Corresponding Source for the Library, and such offer must be valid
for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
work.  (This option is not allowed for works that are already
commercially released under the GNU LGPL.)

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
says it is governed by a certain version of the GNU Lesser General Public
License, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either
of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a version number of the GNU
Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Library.

  7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
  APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
  OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
  THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the
  Library is with you.  Should the Library prove defective, you assume the
  cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify
it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular version of the Library is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the Free Software Foundation expressly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
insists on reinstatement of your license, and if you can successfully
re-establish compliance with all the terms of this License on your own,
to the satisfaction of the copyright holder.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a
copy of the Library.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring
solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a
copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than
this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered
work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.
However, if you cease all infringement, then your license from a particular
version of the Library is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the
Free Software Foundation expressly and finally terminates your license,
and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder insists on reinstatement of your
license, and if you can successfully re-establish compliance with all the
terms of this License on your own, to the satisfaction of the copyright holder.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a
license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
third parties with this License.

  11. Patents.

  A contributor is deemed to grant a patent license to a recipient
if the contributor contributes a covered work, and the recipient
relies on any patent claims that the contributor has contributed
without any additional royalty or compensation, and this patent license
is irrevocable provided the recipient does not bring a patent litigation
against any contributor over that covered work.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you
from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as
to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.

  13. Use with the GNU General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work,
and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to
apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special exceptions
for linking provided in this section will not apply to any modifications
of the covered work.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies that a certain numbered version of this License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either
of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a version number of this License,
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
  APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
  OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
  THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the
  Library is with you.  Should the Library prove defective, you assume the
  cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.
